The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out on the page. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light colours. It's standard, these buttons you will see more often on the website than the other ones.
- The light buttons are for dark background areas. It's easily seen on the page and can be spotted quikcly. These buttons will be on the page sometimes depending on the content.
- The ghost buttons will be used on banners.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
